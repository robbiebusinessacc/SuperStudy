# SuperStudy

SuperStudy is designed to help you stay focused and productive while studying. This project includes three features: Pomodoro Timer, Music Player, and Dark/Light Mode Switch.

## Pomodoro Timer
The Pomodoro Timer is a time management tool that helps you stay focused while studying. It breaks your study sessions into 25-minute intervals, with a 5-minute break in between. You can customize the duration of your study sessions and breaks, and track your progress through the status bar.

## Music Player
The Music Player opens Spotify to play music while you study. Music can help improve your focus and concentration, so you can get more done in less time.

## Dark/Light Mode Switch
The Dark/Light Mode Switch allows you to switch between dark and light mode on your MacOS device. This feature is great for reducing eye strain and creating a more comfortable study environment.
